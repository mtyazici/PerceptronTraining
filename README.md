# PerceptronTraining

Implementation of two layer perceptron network using backpropagation. There are three implementations one is for classification of linearly unseperable data, other one is for data compression of a certain input type and the last one is for function approximation. Trainings can be done in either batch or sequential mode.

This project was an assignment of the course Artifical Neural Networks and Deep Architectures.
